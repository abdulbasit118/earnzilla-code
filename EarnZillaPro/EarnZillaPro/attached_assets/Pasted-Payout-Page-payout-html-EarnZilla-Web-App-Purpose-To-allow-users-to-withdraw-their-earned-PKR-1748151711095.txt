Frontend Logic

Disable submit if:

Amount < 250

Required fields are empty


On submission:

Show loading animation

Store withdrawal request in Firestore under collection withdrawals

Example structure:

{
  uid: "user123",
  amount: 500,
  method: "JazzCash",
  accountNumber: "03001234567",
  name: "Ali Khan",
  status: "pending",
  requestDate: "2025-05-25"
}

Show confirmation toast: “Withdrawal request submitted!”




---

Backend Logic (Firestore + Admin Panel)

Admin reviews requests via admin.html

Status options: pending, paid, rejected

Once status is changed in Firestore:

Update real-time on user payout page using onSnapshot()

Optional: send FCM notification on status change




---

Security Considerations

Firebase Security Rules:

Users can only read/write their own withdrawal records.

Only admin role can change status.


Validate that amount <= user's balance

Deduct balance only after admin approves (not on request)



---

 Enhancements

FCM push notifications on payout status updates.

Email confirmation after payout is approved.

Export history button (PDF/CSV).

Progress bar if withdrawal is processing.
